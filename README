sweeplines.sh is just a simple Bash script I whipped up in about an hour, 
trying to imitate the screensaver that has colorful lines sweep and bounce 
within screen.

It doesn't not have colors nor the sweeping line has a length longer than one 
character.  For sake of simplicity, no random starting positions or direction, 
it always starts at upper-left corning and goes towards southeast.
